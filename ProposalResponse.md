# Group 18 - Hand Gestures

## Tentative Rating
Average. The more usable the gestures and smoother the system, the more likely it will end up above average. It really depends on what techniques you use. Above average for true gesture recognition (i.e. not hacked together).

## Comments
 - You'll need smoothed gyroscopic/accelerometer data to have reasonable results.
 - How do you intend to distinguish between gestures?
 - How do you deal with accidental gestures? Can that happen?

10 / 10
